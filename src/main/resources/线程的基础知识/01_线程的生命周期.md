## 引入JDK文档的一段话
```
NEW: A thread that has not yet started is in this state.(当线程实例被创建时, 即new Thread之
    后调用start方法之前则处于new状态)
  
RUNNABLE: A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.(可运行状态, 当线
          程实例调用了start方法之后并且在未分配到CPU之前则处于该状态)

RUNNING: 线程正在执行          

BLOCKED: A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state.(当线程因争夺
        一个同步锁失败的时候则处于阻塞状态)

WAITING: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular 
        action is in this state.(当调用了wait方法的时候处于等待状态, 等待另一个线程唤醒它)

TIMED_WAITING: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to 
               a specified waiting time is in this state.(当调用sleep方法的时候处于该状态)

TERMINATED: A thread that has exited is in this state.(线程执行完毕或者遇到错误时自动中断)
```
